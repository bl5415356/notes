- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your work. Here are some tips to help with this:

1. Prioritize tasks: When you are working on a project, make sure to list the tasks in order of priority. Focus on the most important tasks first, as this will ensure that you complete the majority of your project on time.
2. Plan ahead: Always think ahead and plan for any potential issues or challenges that may arise. By doing this, you can avoid any last-minute panic and ensure your projects run smoothly. 
3. Stay organized: Use project management tools and software to keep track of all your tasks and deadlines. Organizing your workflow will make it easier to stay on track and complete your goals.  
4. Learn from others: Read blogs, watch tutorials, or join online communities to learn from other developers and their experiences. Not only will this help to improve your own skills, but it will also give you valuable insights into best practices and techniques.   
5. Practice continuous learning: Technology is constantly evolving, so it' s essential to remain up-to-date with the latest developments and trends. Set aside time each week to read articles, attend workshops,or participate in online courses to ensure you're always improving your skills.
